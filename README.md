## Reflection

Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features using React, JavaScript, Material UI, CSS and Firebase Authentication/Firestore Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to chat each other.
I started this process by using the create-react-app boilerplate.
One of the main challenges as follows,
1. Add functions like changing profile photo and profile message.
2. Add function to upload multimedia such as photo, video and voice recording to chat screen. 
3. Add function like searching user name at search field.
4. Add function to delete current chat room(s)
